# About
This is a repository of all the code I have coded in **Android Study Jams**. This repo was created purely for transparency purposes and self learning.

All the code here is meant for self reference and to be referred by others only to learn the implementation. Do not use this repository to copy the code directly, but instead to compare it with yours.

If you have a better code for any of the code posted here, do PR, I'll add it right in.
